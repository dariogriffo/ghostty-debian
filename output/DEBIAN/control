Description: Fast, feature-rich, and cross-platform terminal emulator.
 Ghostty is a terminal emulator that differentiates itself by being fast,
 feature-rich, and native. While there are many excellent terminal emulators
 available, they all force you to choose between speed, features, or native
 UIs. Ghostty provides all three. This is an unofficial package.
